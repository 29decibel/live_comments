LiveComments is (yet another) comments system for any site or web pages. The main idea is the "live" part of it. Meaning you will be able to see the comments right away without refreshing the page after people put their comments to your page.

You could also see who's "online" viewing your page currently (side effects).


## Site owner
Site owner create a site in the LiveComments, then will be able to configure the site. Such as allowed website to load the comments, live vs static, lazy load comments, or even pulling comments from other sources (such as hackernews).

After this, the site owner would be able to get the snippet to put on their blog or website. To render the comments, the only thing required is the __page_id__. Which indicates the where the comments applies to.
